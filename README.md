### Why did we do this?
We did this because we were poor and needed money...

Just kidding. Actually, we just wanted to host a website where people could hold live debates and let spectators decide who makes a better point for whatever the argument is.
### What problem does this solve?
Let's be real, everyone hates arguments. And we all hate how arguments can quickly devolve into cesspools as well. Persuade Me was made as an attempt to avoid all that by letting users choose either one side of an argument, or, if they don't fully agree with either side, choose to remain neutral.

And as for having the option to remain neutral in a debate, we included that option because the reality is that many, if not most, arguments have a gray area that isn't just "My side good, your side bad" or anything else along that line.
### What did we learn?
We learned what WebSocket is and how we can use it to make our app instead of the usual HTTP requests.
